    &lt;p&gt;Transforming the chaos of personal data into personalized, holistic health insights—to empower you to achieve your full potential!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wellround, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Notes&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the motto of Wellround. This is our north star. And now if you wish to follow along, I will bring you to the beginning of our Journey, navigating towards the north star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;start-with-why&#34;&gt;Start with why.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every adventure starts with a desire, a burning spirit of search. Curiosity and knowledge power the engine of our ever working mind, but sometimes the sources of energy come less and so does our motivation. Our grit is tested, and in these moments of doubt the world seems to be untractable and we fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure every single reader of this passage would have felt this, it is not only my feeling, but rather an alarming statistics. Sooner or later that might happen, and too often such minima of one&amp;rsquo;s life, might be fatal. This is our main motivation for building. This moves progress in our code and plans. It started as a personal journey, that we felt on our skin. We were able to get back up and we learned to &amp;ldquo;tryfall&amp;rdquo;. We have been lucky and we want to transform our luck into a actionable value for as many people as we can reach. This is why Wellround was founded.
We know that each one of us is unique and irreplaceable, precious. Because of this our philosophy is based on the assumption that everyone experiences and reacts to life in uncountable many different ways. It is quite impossible to cover every scenario and every possibility with traditional technology, but with the rise of smartwatches, IoT, and Large Language Models, the problem becomes very much more tractable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how&#34;&gt;How?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new technologies that are enabling this new AI revolution are the core of the solution we are proposing. By leveraging the chaos of data that everyone of us produce, we will give recommendations and actionable insights on what people can do. We will not only use data from a single source, but we are going to correlate datapoints from as many sources as possible. Even if now the sources seems not enough, the future is going to be exponential and the only limit we see is the sky. So stick with us and learn together with us what limitless really means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what&#34;&gt;What?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the simplest of the three points. Again it will be like magic. You will not be bothered by settings here or useless notifications. No nothing like that, forget all your previous experiences. Wellround will become an extension of your body, a digital twin where you can reliably get advices, help and improve to achieve your full potential. So far we only talked about technology, but we know that ultimately we are social beings, and we want also to revert the trend of people going online to solve their problems. This is why we are creating communities on our application to support meetings and activities offline as much as possible. Because in the end &amp;ldquo;No &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; is an Island&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;action-action-so-what-do-i-do&#34;&gt;Action, action, so what do I do?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you read so far, you have done the first step to achieve your full potential, congratulations 🎉. If are already embarked in your journey, I wish you all the best,
might you achieve it in the end. If you are curious to try out our roadmap and copilot for the journey, download our app, is FREE at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;www.wellround.me&#34; &gt;www.wellround.me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TinySplat</title>
        <link>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/tiny-splat/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 10:21:13 +0200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/tiny-splat/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/tiny-splat/tinysplat_small.jpg" alt="Featured image of post TinySplat" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;tinysplat&#34;&gt;Tinysplat
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my the journey to understand Gaussian Splatting, I created Tinysplat as a hands-on project to explore its foundational concepts. By breaking down the complex process into more manageable parts, I aimed to simplify and clarify the underlying mechanisms. In this post, I’ll share the insights and discoveries I’ve made along the way, shedding light on the essentials of Gaussian Splatting through the lens of my experience with Tinysplat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-gaussian-splatting&#34;&gt;What is Gaussian Splatting?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaussian splatting is a novel explicit surface representation developed to represent the 3D structure of an object or an environment and then convert (rasterize) them into 2D images to be shown on our screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2 most important pieces of this concept are: Gaussian and Splatting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gaussians&#34;&gt;Gaussians
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaussians is a shorthand for Gaussian distribution, which we are familiar from statistics in 1 dimension. Hold tight because in this process the dimensions of the Gaussian distribution will go up to 2 and 3. The most intuitive way to think of a Gaussian in 3 dimensions (with a lot of abuse in notation) is to think about it as a balloon. Of this balloon we can control different proprieties such as the rotation, the color, the size, by inflating it more or less etc.
Turns out that in the Gaussian Splatting process, we build the environment by merging together many of these balloons of different dimensions and colors at different positions in the space. Take a look at the following image:&lt;/p&gt;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;100&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;240px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can think of a car being made of many balloons at different positions and different sizes and colors, but then you can observe this shape from many points and always understand that this is a car.
And this brings us to the second key concept: splatting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;splatting&#34;&gt;Splatting
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Splatting is not a new concept and it refers to the technique of rendering each pixel on your monitor as the combination of many Gaussian-shaped &amp;ldquo;splats&amp;rdquo; (or balloons) by blending each contribution of each balloon given the camera position.
You might wonder what is special about this technique. Well in a single words it is DIFFERENTIABLE. It means that we can run back-propagation to whatever loss we have and therefore manipulating the properties of every balloons in our scene. To some degree we can think of differentiability as being a human inside the room that can listen to our commands shouting from a small window telling him where he should move every balloon to create an object. Without differentiability we would not have a way to communicate to the person inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/tiny-splat/explanation.jpeg&#34;
	width=&#34;1024&#34;
	height=&#34;1024&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/tiny-splat/explanation_hu6562073399138009442.jpeg 480w, https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/tiny-splat/explanation_hu14846136555838797151.jpeg 1024w&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;100&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;240px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine there is no &amp;ldquo;open window&amp;rdquo; and no way for the two guys to communicate. Then the process will be NON differentiable. It is exactly the communication that was the key to enable many interesting applications of Gaussian splatting. Remember &amp;ldquo;Communication is key&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-why&#34;&gt;But why?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then you might ask why do we need to have a man inside a house inflating balloons and one guy outside observing and shouting?! Well that&amp;rsquo;s a fair question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In proper terminology what this techniques enable is to learn from just a handful of images, on the order of the hundreds, a whole object or environment, so hopefully we can generate &amp;ldquo;novel views&amp;rdquo;. This fancy term refers basically that we can generate a rough 3D reconstruction from these images.
Again in technical terms we are over-fitting a scene or also inferring from the images we have at our disposal, what would the image look like from a completely different point of view that we didn&amp;rsquo;t have before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion this technique is called explicit neural radiance Field. The explicit term references the fact that the parameters of the Gaussians are stored as is, and in the weights as in the NeRF representation for example. Radiance field instead is just a fancy word that was chosen to describe the way that rays are captured by the camera coming from all the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;okay-balloons-and-communication-now-what&#34;&gt;Okay, balloons and communication, now what?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a legit question. How do we even generate these Gaussians, and even how do we position them? We don&amp;rsquo;t have a human in the computer, let alone 2 people communicating!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey of creating a realistic scene is split into 2 parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initialization of the priors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fitting of the priors onto the images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;priors-initialization&#34;&gt;Priors initialization
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaussian splatting works better if we have already a rough idea of what the scene looks like. Imagine having some rough sketch of what you want, it is going to be easier to realize your masterpiece. In the same way, Gaussian Splatting works best when our initial sketch is a Point Cloud. A point cloud is exactly a way to define a rough sketch of the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common way to obtain is to run an algorithm called Structure from Motion. In other words given images of the scene from different positions it will triangulate the points and create a 3D representation which is close enough to reality. These methods are still improving and there is no best approach but it depends on many factors such as dimensions, motions etc. In the end this is still an open research question, therefore many more options (hopefully) are coming every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can have a look of what that means. The red &amp;ldquo;things&amp;rdquo; (camera frustums), represent the rotation and position of the cameras in space, whilst the points (which should be colored), they represent the 3D space that was reconstructed. It is called &amp;ldquo;sparse&amp;rdquo; reconstruction because as you might have noticed, it is missing a lot of points, but the 3D high level idea can be interpreted by a human at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/tiny-splat/sfm_example.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1559&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;151&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;363px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this rough initialization has been created is time to go to next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fitting-of-the-gaussians-more-technical&#34;&gt;Fitting of the Gaussians (more technical)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part is the most mindblowing and difficult, so take a deep breath and let&amp;rsquo;s dive into cold waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have some images, the position and rotation of the cameras, where the image was taken and the priors point cloud, the real training begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works very similar as in neural networks, where we have a set of parameters that needs to optimized using some gradient descent algorithm such as SGD. In this case all gaussians are initialized with the color and point in 3D space provided by the SfM algorithm. The scale and rotations are initialized as standard values such as 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During training we use these values to create and project the Gaussians onto the screen in a &lt;strong&gt;differentiable manner&lt;/strong&gt;. This will produce some strange images at first, by projecting all the gaussians to the screen that is orientated and positioned in the same way as the way the image was taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way we have a reference of what the image should be at that position, and what we actually get from the &amp;ldquo;splatting&amp;rdquo; process. Now you might have understood already, we can calculate a &lt;strong&gt;loss&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;difference&lt;/strong&gt; in similarity between the two images. There are 2 ways this difference is computed, and usually is a combination of different losses such as f1 loss, and SSIM loss, where $\lambda$ is a parameter used to balance the two accuracies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
(1 - \lambda) * \text{F1-loss(img1, img2)} + \lambda * \text{SSIM(img1, img2)}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way iterating over the many images in the dataset, batch by batch, we can optimize the parameters of the whole number of Gaussians by backpropagating the error back to each gaussian based on the (sum) of the error(s) from every pixel in each image.
By optimizing these parameters, after some epochs, a clear image can be seen. A 2D example is displayed below. What you see is a video of the training where the Gaussians gets progressively refined and the final result is a sharp and crisp image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a good introductory article to Gaussian splatting in a non-technical way. If you would like to dig deeper into the topics I am compiling a series of blog post where I show the implementation of Gaussian Splatting in 2D &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/04_notebook/tinysplat/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and in the future also in 3D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will leave another list of good material that helped me understand better the topic. Let me know if this was helpful, and especially how I can improve!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;after defining all these variables that hopefully makes sense to you, we will use said variables to display an image containing the Gaussians defined with these variables.
We need to remember that we always want all these process to be differentiable so to have the created image compared to a loss and back-propagate the error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-gaussian-splatting&#34;&gt;Introduction to Gaussian splatting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This function takes as input the above variables and returns an image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we need to get the inverse of the covariance matrix to be used to create the Gaussian. The inverse method is nicely implemented in torch, but since we are on hardcore mode, we have to implement it ourselves. Luckily the matrices are only 2x2, therefore the method is straightforward.
We also return the determinant since it will come handy later on, and we will save some computations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now into the interesting part and where the visualization will come in useful. At this point we need to create some matrices to insert the values picked from the Gaussian distribution. To do so we need to create the matrix in a smart way as again there is no out of the pocket function that does so in tinygrad.
I like tinygrad because it makes us to go to the bottom of things in order to work.
(on the other hand you will figure out that if you want to do more complex things, this becomes quite difficult)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have 3 in this case, but n in the general case gaussian kernels. To each pixel will be associated a value for transparency or opacity. As you can not very well there are colors missing. Also we want to merge all these Gaussian kernels into a single image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will do the following in two steps as described below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiply each kernel with the RGB value associated (initialized in the previous values)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sum the rgb Gaussians along each rgb channel to get the final colors and shapes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing the new function with new values will bring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: converting from torch to tinygrad meant losing some out of the box function such as affine_grid, which required some advanced algorithms such as bilinear interpolation to work. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time and deep knowledge on how to make it work on tinygrad I directly skipped that step. On the other side that particular function was needed to learn the translation matrix for the Gaussian I had to make it learnable from some other place.
As you might have noticed, I shifted the kernel directly when I was creating it. A problem of this is that the kernel has to already be the size of the image, which will alterate the meaning of mu and the covariance matrix, when the kernel dimensions change.
Therefore because of that you will see in the next cell, that the scale_x and scale_y values are downsized by the ration of img size and kernel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this first training we are also using TinyJIT() to JIT our code and make it faster. On my small benchmarks with JIT I got 40 seconds less time over 1000 iterations, just for free. It is my first experiment with Tinygrad and I will dig deeper in the next parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the next parts are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the training faster and try to remove and optimize code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make more benchmark with different amounts of Gaussians&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add one important step -&amp;gt; densification process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading, this was part 1 of the series on Gaussian splatting. Let me know if you find any errors or have any suggestions. I will be happy to hear from you, just create a pull request or an issue on the github repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for the next part where we will densify the Gaussians and make the training faster and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also 3D Gaussians is coming soon hopefully!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sebastian Cavada, Alvaro Berobide, Yevheniia Kryklyvets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This manuscript evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art time series analysis algorithms for depression detection on the GLOBEM dataset. We assess TSMixer, Crossformer, GRU, CNN_LSTM and introduce a novel self-developed algorithm with the goal of increasing accuracy over the original Reorder. While these models demonstrate robust out-of-domain generalization, they fail to surpass the accuracy of the baseline Reorder algorithm, which was specifically developed for in-domain analysis by the GLOBEM team. Our findings reveal consistently low performance across all models, suggesting limitations inherent in the dataset rather than the algorithms themselves. We hypothesize that the dataset’s absence of critical variables and insufficient granularity likely limits model convergence. This hypothesis is supported by similar studies that achieved higher accuracy using more frequent data points with similar architecture approaches. Based on these insights, we suggest that future studies might benefit from incorporating more granular sensor measurements and more sophisticated data types such as, but not limited to, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My first hackathon in the UAE - Pioneers 4.0</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/03_projects/edge-hackathon/image.png" alt="Featured image of post My first hackathon in the UAE - Pioneers 4.0" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-first-hackathon-in-the-uae&#34;&gt;My first Hackathon in the UAE
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to participate in the Pioneers4.0 Hackathon, organized by the Edge together with MoAT and partner LIPTON tea. It was a 72-hour event, where we had to develop an optimization solution to optimize the production and blending of tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was part of a team of 5 people, and we were able to develop a solution that was able to optimize the production of tea, considering the different types of tea and the different blends that could be made. We used a simple rule-based algorithm to optimize the production and blending of tea, and we were able to present a working prototype at the end of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a great experience, and I was able to learn a lot about the tea industry and the challenges that the industry faces. I also learned a lot about the different types of tea and the different blends that can be made. It was a great opportunity to work with a team of people from different backgrounds and to learn from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also managed to win the competition with a mix of team-work, creativity as well as technical skills. It was a great experience and I am looking forward to participating in more hackathons in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the Edge and MoAT for organizing the event, and to LIPTON tea as well. I am looking forward to be part of the LIPTON team in the future, with the internship that I was awarded at the end of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial I want to show you guys how to go from two distinct images to a single image that is the result of the two images stitched together. This is a very useful technique in computer vision and it is used in many applications such as panorama stitching, object detection and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting images:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIFT algorithm is going to be used for keypoint extraction and feature description. The algorithm is going to be initialized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next two images are going to be used for the demonstration of the algorithm.
IMPORTANT: the images should be ordered from the left to the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the images open now the SIFT algorithm can be run on each of them. The keypoints and descriptors are going to be extracted and stored in the variables kp1, des1, kp2, des2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following are the two images with the descriptors visualized. It can be noted that some of the descriptors are similar and in similar positions in both images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;feature-matching&#34;&gt;Feature matching
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the points have been computed, the next step is to match the points. This is done by using the FLANN algorithm. This Algorithm is faster than the brute force approach and gives the same accuracy. It involves trees and it is a best fit when the number of matches is high, which is exactly our case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After matching the points a further refinement is done with the ratio test. This test is used to filter out the points that are not similar enough. The test is done by comparing the distance of the closest point to the distance of the second closest point. If the ratio is less than a certain threshold, the point is considered a good match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is shown in the figure below. The matches are visualized with lines connecting the points. It can be seen that the matches are not perfect, this is why we are going to refine them in the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the previous image it can be seen that some green lines do not match corresponding keypoints. This is why we are going to use the RANSAC algorithm to further refine the matches. The RANSAC algorithm is going to be used to find the best transformation between the two images. The transformation is going to be used to warp the second image to the first one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular the RANSAC algorithm works as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Randomly select n points from the matches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute the transformation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Count the number of inliers, that is, if we take this transformation as the correct one, how many points are close to the transformed points (we need to consider all the points and not only the n points we used to compute the transformation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the process for a number of iterations to find the best combination of points that minimizes the transformation error&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the iteration is finished we can consider with a high degree of confidence that the current transformation is the closest to the real one. The transformation is then used to warp the second image to the first one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the code you see above seems gibberish, but is actually the implementation of the bullet points that I described earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;def transform(...)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;is responsible for transforming the source points to the destination points given any homgraphy matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;def myFindHomography(...)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is responsible for finding the homography matrix given the source and destination points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;def findBestHomography(...)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is responsible to run the RANSAC algorithm and find the best homography matrix. It calls many times both the previous functions to find the best homography matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we can compute the best homography matrix and warp the second image to the first one. We also get the indices of the points that are inliers and we can visualize them. We remove all points that are not the best fits by applying the mask to the matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;stitching-the-two-images&#34;&gt;Stitching the two images
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last part of the code involves creating a new frame for the images based on their projected new positions. The new frame is going to be the calculated from the new coordinates of the second image projected by the homography matrix and the original frame of the first image. The new frame is going to be the maximum of the two frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the function $\text{cv2.warpPerspective}$ is going to be used to warp the second image to the first one. The result is shown in the figure below. It can be seen that the second image is now warped to the first one and the two images are now aligned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Especially in the last one it can be noted that the images have different colors. In the next section we are going to see how to fix this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;photometric-correction&#34;&gt;Photometric correction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As promised the two images have been stitched together and the result is shown in the figure above. The process is quite simple and it is based on the extraction of keypoints and descriptors, the matching of the keypoints and the refinement of the matches with the RANSAC algorithm. The final result is a single image that is the result of the two images stitched together.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A BIG day in AI</title>
        <link>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/big-day-inai/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 10:21:13 +0200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/big-day-inai/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/big-day-inai/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post A BIG day in AI" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-big-day-in-ai&#34;&gt;A BIG day in AI
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I woke up this morning and as usual, the fatigue to go running was there. I did and ran my 6.5k in around 33 minutes, a very good time and a bit unexpected. Days like this are a sign of a good day. Then while having breakfast with my favorite news platform namely x.com, I started seeing so many posts about Gemini 1.5. Then suddenly a lot of videos and tweets about some text-video model. I was confused. I was excited. OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s name was there, it must be something big I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started watching the first video I was shocked. I thought this was light years away. And there I was with my cereal bowl and the best AI-generated videos I have ever seen. I was very excited.
At the same time I was also doubtful: &amp;ldquo;What am I studying for then&amp;rdquo;. Many things have been solved in AI already and this was a big step toward AGI, or as I would discover later to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as much excited and doubtful as I was I went back to my desk and started studying Gradient Descent and learning rates. It was the right thing to do, but still, it was weird, that I felt I knew so little yet so much had been done.
After the session, I went to lunch with my dear friends Alvaro and Hassan. We discussed about random stuff and passports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started reading about this new model and the more video I was watching the more strange I was feeling. I saw some guy on the web doing already 3d reconstruction with such videos. I am working on the same topic. I had to try so I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the meanwhile the highlight of the day and surely of the year, was that the GOAT Yann Le Cun was visiting the campus here today. When I found that out the previous day, I was thrilled. I always looked up to him as an example and took so much inspiration from his talks and works.
It was a unique moment of deep knowledge, critical thinking and first-principle reasoning. His insights were great and gave me hope for what I was thinking in the morning. My generation has the hope to still make an impact in the research field and hopefully as well for society and the world.
The questions were not many as the time was limited, and only a handful stood out to me as new and thought-provoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My supervisor asked the question (that many are wondering) if academia can still compete with the industry in terms of research. The answer wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite clear, but the main point is that academia should challenge the industry with new ideas and most importantly propose new paradigms to solve the problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second clever question worth noting is about what are the pillars that are most likely unchanging in the future of AI. The answer comprised 4 main points: backpropagation, the gradient, the minimization of an objective and the GPU. The first three are needed for the learning itself, the latest is the bottleneck of the learning process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another worth mentioning concept was the way he mentioned that the Transformer can answer any question, but it will always answer questions using the same amount of computation. This is how it is trained, and what it is supposed to do. But we don&amp;rsquo;t behave like this. If a question is harder we spend more computational power/time to come up with the correct answer. I was enthusiastic about this concept and I feel it is worth exploring more.
These are some photos I was able to take with Yann Le Cun. The whole community was trying to get some photos and this is the best I could get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![A photo all together]A sneak peek of the talk](IMG_5686.jpg)![A closer selfie with the GOAT]I hope to see him in the future as he is a great scientist and engineer as he calls himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all the day went pretty well, I was able to finish the 3D Gaussian reconstruction I started earlier, which led me to do a video and post it on YouTube. I got also some comments from the video of the campus tour of the university and I was happy to see that people are interested in what we are doing here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBUqiYNm-Rs&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might do a video about how I did it, and it is just simple software used one after the other. The peculiarity here is that the video was generated by an AI model, with emergent 3D capabilities. In other words, the 3D information was consistent throughout the video, and this is a big step toward the future of AI-generated videos.
This was also proved by the good even if not perfect results I got from the 3D reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blob detection with Laplacian of Gaussian</title>
        <link>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/04_notebook/assignment02/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 14:31:13 +0200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/04_notebook/assignment02/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The following tutorial and notebook is about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementation of &lt;strong&gt;LoG blob detection algorithm&lt;/strong&gt; to detect flowers in the given flowers.png picture. This part also includes comparison between the method implemented from scratch and the one provided by OpenCV library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementation of LoG with &lt;strong&gt;normalized scale variations&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.08328.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;A multiscale Laplacian of Gaussian(LoG) filtering approach to pulmonary nodule detection from
whole-lung CT scans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance of additional experiments with different &lt;strong&gt;threshold values&lt;/strong&gt; for both algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;implementation-of-unnormalized-laplacian-of-gaussian-filter-for-blob-detection&#34;&gt;Implementation of unnormalized Laplacian of Gaussian filter for blob detection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The idea:&lt;/strong&gt; Convolve an image with multiple different-scale &amp;ldquo;blob&amp;rdquo; filters and look for the zero-crossings in order to find edges in the specific scale space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laplacian is a second-order derivative scale invariant filter. Unlike first-order filters, Laplacian detects the edges at zero crossings i.e. where the value changes from negative to positive and vice-versa. To reduce the noise effect, image is first smoothed with a Gaussian filter and then we find the zero crossings using Laplacian. This two-step process is called the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
LoG(x,y) = -\frac{1}{\pi \sigma^4} \left [1 - \frac{x^2 + y^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right] \exp^{- \frac{x^2 + y^2}{2 \sigma^2}}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To have an idea about what kind of output we should expect from implemented algorith we decided to firs run the LoG function available in the scikit-image library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here you can see all of the steps that are being taken in order to further detect the &amp;ldquo;blobs&amp;rdquo;. First row displays the impact of each sigma value on the kernel and its values - those are kernels used for convolution. Second row shows the imact of the convolution operation on the original image with regard to sigma. Last line shows how thresholding  impacts the number of blobs that are &amp;ldquo;activated&amp;rdquo; after LoG filter. More on that in the last part of this task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is an example of how the circles or blobs are chosen. First we divide the image into chunks, with different size according to the sigma value. Then for every chunck, a maximum point is selected and it becomes the center of the blob for that particular value of sigma. We highlighted the patches where there is maximum activation in the image for the sigma of value 8. It is noticeable even if a bit hard to see the different shades of white and gray. The most white part is in the middle of the blob usually and it is the exact point chose as the center of the circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in order to achieve maximum accuracy we needed to pad the image to divide the image without any pixel being left out. We can do that and we pad with the black color as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect the choice of the maximum point in the blob.
Without this small tweaking, some blobs near the edge vere left out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We implemented a very simple non-maximum-suppression, which is accurate and at the same time very fast. The idea is that we start from the bigger blobs and we give more importance to them. If smaller blobs are found inside the bigger blobs, they are eliminated from the blobs list. If the blobs are too close, less than the square root of the square of the radius of the two circles than the second one is also eliminated. The list is shrinked dynamically so that the computational cost is always less than O(n^2). On an average case scenario where nearly half of the blobs are eliminated the computational cost is closer to O(n*logn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see when comparing the algorithm from scratch (left) to the pre-build one from skimage (right), we can see that hand built algorithm actually has less outliers and targets the values that correspond to the flower centers, while the pre-build one has a lot more of small, let&amp;rsquo;s say &amp;rsquo;noisy&amp;rsquo; circles that don&amp;rsquo;t contribute to the blobs, which gives the feeling that it targets highlights rather that the dark spots. As per the outliers in the from-scratch algorithm, they can be removed with the help of &amp;ldquo;normalization&amp;rdquo;. We will talk about it in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;test-with-light-blobs&#34;&gt;Test with light blobs
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also tested and compared our algorithm with the famous implementation on skimage. There are some difference. But overall we can say that it approximates it with high degree of accuracy. First of all the implementation identifies light blobs on dark background while our implementation works the opposite way. Therefore for a good comparation we had to invert our initial function and compare in this way.
We can see that they have many mor smaller point, than we have. That is due to the fact that they might have allowed more threshold in the first place. Secondly in their approach we can see less bigger circles or blobs. We are not sure about why, but a possible explanation is because they did normalize (again this far we haven&amp;rsquo;t normalized the LoG yet) and also because of the non-maximum-suppression algorithm that they implemented which might be a bit more sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The idea:&lt;/strong&gt; Increase effectiveness of the filtering of the original image with scale-normalized LoG kernels of continuously changing scale parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normalization is necessary to eliminate the effect of decreasing spatial derivatives with the increase of scale and is defined as the negated multiplication of LoG by σ2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
L_{norm}(X, σ)
$$
is the scale-space representation obtained for image I(X) by convolving it with normalized Gaussian kernel at continuous set of scales&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\nabla^2_{norm} L(X, \sigma) = \nabla^2_{norm} G(X, \sigma) * I(X)

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this second part of the code we implemented a slightly different blob detection that finds the maximum across all the images convolved with different kernels. This is the main difference from the previous blob detection algorithm. This can be done now, because all the values have been normalized and therefore the maximum is consisten across all different activation function images. This way the image can be divided into many chunks of fixed sized and for each the maximum is found, then if it above the global threshold it is then considered a blob. In the end the same algorithm of non-maximum suprression has been applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see a result of normalized LoG blob detection based on some &amp;ldquo;random&amp;rdquo; input hyperparameters. These are: step size, sigma, threshold and number of convolutions (these values were taken from multiple papers/lecture slides as &amp;ldquo;optimal&amp;rdquo;). In order to get a better detection we had to fine tune the parameters. Below you can see the results (including non-maximum suppression to reduce number of overlapping blobs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, we have three output images: (1) - Normalized LoG, (2) - Non-Normalized Log, and (3) - Pre-built function. One difference is clear from the beginning, the algorithm of skimage has more granular results and the size of the detected blob is smaller than our algorithm. This initial difference is mainly due to the parameters of the algorithm. Secondly, it can be shown that the center of the sunflower is not detected but rather the petals are. This means that the skimage algorithm is using the same function as us \textbf{but} with a plus in front of it.
As per the two algorithms done from scratch, both result in a rather precise detection. As expected, the normalized algorithm produced fewer outliers, due to the stronger response in the case of successful matching, and better results as it is more precise in finding the center of the blob.
It has to be noted that the absence of smaller blobs in the first two images can be traced to two main factors: 1) higher threshold value and 2) different sigma range implementation in the algorithm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see from the examples below, threshold values are very important for the output. For the analysis we decided to go with gradual increase of the threshold, starting with 0.0 and with the max value of 0.08. As it was expected, threshold value and number of blobs are inversely proportional - with the increase of threshold we observe decrease in a blob count.
For the 0.0 value we basically received white image (without non-max supression it would have been fully covered with white, having the number of detected pixels that &amp;ldquo;contribute&amp;rdquo; to blob) - this happened due to the fact that we pretty much don&amp;rsquo;t threshold at all and let all maximum pixel intensities contribute to blobs (each pixel has a max within the 8-dimensional kernel, so all pixels will have to be activated). Here we can also see that with the given hyperparameters there are almost no pixels with intencities higher that 0.06 (last two examples), so to be able to tune the threshold to the &amp;ldquo;optimal value&amp;rdquo; in this set up we will have to search for the value between 0.02, although this is still very little value that produces too much noise, and 0.06 (with 0.04 being latest greatest pick).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see during these additional tests, normalized LoG implemented from scratch does work on different images. Although, it worth mentioning afain that the key is in tuning the hyperparameters with regard to the input data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-histogram-equalization&#34;&gt;1. Histogram equalization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can achieve histogram equalization in two main ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equalize every channel in the RGB image and then stack them together again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert the image into a format where the luminance is isolated perform histogram normalization on that channel and then convert back the image to RGB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common method to perform histogram equalization is to process every channel in the RGB image separately and then stack them together to form another RGB image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this approach, we performed the first histogram equalization using the built-in function in OpenCV which takes in input an array of values and outputs the equalized array of values. The input and output are of type &lt;strong&gt;np.uint8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first figure we can clearly see that none of the histograms resembles a uniform distribution, on the opposite the 3 histograms have a high spike on the left end of the graph, meaning a majority of dark colors and low-intensity is present, as indeed is expected from the big influence of the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second figure instead, the histograms were stretched to approximate a uniform distribution. That can be seen from the line of the cumulative distribution that is constantly increasing closely following a line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hsi-intensity-equalization&#34;&gt;HSI intensity equalization
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second technique foresees that the images need first to be transformed into another color space the HSI. In the HSI color space, the three channels are Hue, Saturation and Intensity. In this color space, the intensity is not scattered among three different channels as it happens to be in RGB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-contrast-streching&#34;&gt;2. Contrast streching
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;we implemented contrast stretching as proposed in chapter 3.2 in the book Digital Image Processing proposed as reading material in CV701. In this case we use two values namely alpha1 and alpha2, that delimits the starting point and endingn point of the streching zone in the input mapping. We then create a linear function that maps the input to an output in the range defined by beta1 and beta2. The full code is implemented in following cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start our series of exepriments by changing the values of alpha and beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaving alpha and beta with the same values should give us the same exact image, since every intensity is mapped to the same intensity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We decrease the range of beta and shift it to the right end of the image. This should produce a very light image, indeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next to images we decrease the range of the values in output and we shift them to the left-end of the histogram, so the image becomes even darker&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;given the modularity of the function &lt;strong&gt;stretch_channel&lt;/strong&gt; we can also modify each channel with its own alpha and value, to get the most contrast out of the image.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thresholding&#34;&gt;Thresholding

        <description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/contexts/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Euregio Brussels school" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;part-1---the-plane&#34;&gt;Part 1 - the plane
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am writing from the plane. I am in the first row in the middle. I feel I am very lucky. My week of lectures has ended this morning with a discussion on the migration problem in the EU. It was something I have never experienced because we had to take the side of the politicians that don’t accept or better want to protect the EU from immigration. Usually this is the opposite to what I think and it was good for me to push myself out of the bubble and try to see everything from a new prospective. I can’t lie that it was difficult to be in the shoes of people that uses hate and aversion towards the different and the unknown to get votes and get things done, because this is what it does boil down to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this experience I really felt what it is to be on the other side and even more I realize how much I tend to be a “super-part” everyday life. Here is where the inception happens. Through meditation I learned to be equanimous and be balanced on most topics. Then reading the book “reality transurfing” in the past weeks I learned how wise and useful it is not to take any side in discussion or idealisms. And in the end this week I experienced the importance of taking a side and trying to be on the side of the right. And here I also see both the arguments to take a position and not to take a position. I am equanimous. According to the meditation we should always have in mind to reduce suffering and that’s what I have in mind for the future and I would always like to deploy all my resources towards this goal.
As a concluding anecdote, I wanted to share my experience with homeless people I met in Bruxelles, because yes where the most money are the most poverty is as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This homeless people where there on the streets and I wanted to do anything to help. Probably I didn’t. I could have shared a loaf of bread that in the end I had to throw away. I could have brought them some items I have bought from too good to go, but I felt it was wrong and I felt embarrassed, but most of all I didn’t know if that was the right way to act. In this regard I think there is no, or very little, actions that can be done at that very moment to solve something, but I am a big fun of compounded interest and doing small, or big, things over a long period of time in order to really solve a problem.
This proved to be successful different times. Especially I realized this with my education: there was no single thing that I could have done different, because in the end they brought me at this point. Now I really want to focus only on a handful things, do them at a very high level and be able then to give value to many through my work and time. With this I want to say that we are in this together, we are all excellent at speaking or writing, but will we have the courage to act and really put our words into actions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope so and I will bring this experience with me and use it as a tool for my next decisions to be aligned with the goal of giving the most and making this place a little better because of my presence. If I could help a single person than my goal will be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in a cloud now, there is some turbulence and I will have to close now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;part-2---the-train&#34;&gt;Part 2 - the train
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I start to write the second and conclusive part here in the train. I was able to get a good train going to Pandora and I am still active and I feel I would like to write or relax.
I still don’t believe what happened on the plane. It is so strange, yet so beautiful. Some times I think is karma other I just understand that it is only a coincidence. Maybe it was just how the algorithms of Ryanair works in assigning random places. Actually it probably don’t assign random all places but it will prefer the ones that has no additional value first. Then maybe I was a bit late for the check in and they first because all the others were already taken (?). This is a big supposition but I am grateful that happen, and at the same time I now realized that I should be equanimous and don’t crave this feelings but rather really live to the fullest every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this proposition I realized how better it is to really always try to live to the fullest. Life is short and it does not have any prefixed length. So living everyday in the present is the real life hack. And also memento more has become increasingly more important as if a person lives a life with a purpose and a direction whenever it will end it will be a good life. If someone might not have a purpose or direction that might be a bit more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think in this regard in the comments and I will leave you with a couple of photos of my and our class in  Bruxelles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ciao!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ChatGPT</title>
        <link>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/chatgpt/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 10:21:13 +0200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/chatgpt/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/chatgpt/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post ChatGPT" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-chatgpt&#34;&gt;What is &amp;ldquo;chatGPT&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think chatGPT needs much of an introduction. It entered in our lives in late November and it is not going to go away for a long while now. It allows user to write some prompts and get a Natural Language model to answer in any language an to pretty much any question that he get posed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one way or another, most of us has come into contact with this &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; Fanta scientific technology coming from the future. This is the trajectory we are going to follow for the next years. If there are 20 &amp;ldquo;Megatrends&amp;rdquo; well AI is going to lead them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But enough with speculations, I wanted to share my thoughts on the ethic of using such tools in every day life and where might the boundaries be, from using it to sharpen our knowledge or to fake being smart and pretend to be someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore I asked to the direct interested one. ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-input&#34;&gt;The input
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is it ethical for a student to use chatGPT, in order to write faster motivational letters, and draft of emails in order to save time to concentrate more on other creative stuff, research and in general other more interesting stuff, given that is not counterproductive? Another example would be to write a motivational letter to enter a course in which he has a lot of interest but too many things to do for preparing a well written and professional text&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-answer&#34;&gt;The answer
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is ultimately up to the individual to decide whether using a tool like ChatGPT to write motivational letters or emails is ethical. However, it is important to consider the potential consequences of using such a tool. If the student&amp;rsquo;s use of ChatGPT results in a letter or email that is not their own work and does not accurately reflect their own thoughts and writing abilities, it could be considered plagiarism and may lead to disciplinary action. Additionally, if the student relies too heavily on ChatGPT and does not put in the effort to improve their own writing skills, they may not be adequately prepared for future academic or professional writing tasks. Ultimately, it&amp;rsquo;s best to use these tools as a tool to help you and not a replacement of your own efforts and skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;well&#34;&gt;Well
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is sharp and concise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the student&amp;rsquo;s use of ChatGPT results in a letter or email that is not their own work and does not accurately reflect their own thoughts and writing abilities, it could be considered plagiarism and may lead to disciplinary action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This short phrase, collects all my thoughts and showcase them in the most brilliant form. The reflection of our own abilities can really be seen in a text, but mostly our actions and things we did and that we take as ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-my-grandmother-thinks&#34;&gt;What my grandmother thinks
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have talked about this tool with my grandmother and as always when I talk about technology she feels far away from this witchcrafts. She said something interesting thought that can be taken as a starting point of some thoughts flow.
She said and I quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything great is done by people, just like you and if you want to do something great it has to come from yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is literally afraid of what technology can do even if she acknowledges what good has been brought by innovations. Having said that she doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to do with such things, she is too old to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;finally-me&#34;&gt;Finally me
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end I don&amp;rsquo;t have any answer in this world, yet(?), but something I can tell for sure. If the goal is to go from A to B, you might decide to get by bike, by foot or even by car. I think is ultimately up to us to choose the method in which we reach any goal. Surely it has to be consistent to our thoughts, and just because we have a car and therefore we can visit all the places in a year that will take a lifetime to do by foot, means we are better off. We just had a different journey, maybe it was even worst then the second person&amp;rsquo;s one. I hope you can see the analogy here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal and the end of a person has to stay the same, with time this tool will allow to get there, with less risks, maybe even faster and with some different path. Ultimately is the goal we reach that fulfil ourselves and the journey we took there, definitely not the tools used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can learn during the process, always be integrity with ourselves and never faking our abilities and accomplishments, it will become irrelevant which tools are we using and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-am-no-oracle&#34;&gt;I am no Oracle
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how I came to think now, but I am very curios about other&amp;rsquo;s prospective and ideas. Let&amp;rsquo;s create a healthy discussion in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Realverse</title>
        <link>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/realverse/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 14:31:13 +0200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/realverse/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/realverse/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Realverse" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;for-a-biscuit&#34;&gt;For a biscuit
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was late October and during a lesson of entrepreneurship and innovation the class moved outside to take a picture with the guest lecturer from the company &amp;ldquo;Dr. Schär&amp;rdquo;. He told us about his personal story and his business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was walking out the building and I casually met a person, who offered me a biscuit and we just started chatting about how the seminar went and why we were there. We spent more than an hour chatting around in the cold and under the rain, so I had to take the later bus. But it was worth it all the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-a-hackathon&#34;&gt;Why a hackathon
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julian and I kept in touch, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until the hackathon of November that we met in person and went off with two different teams. In that occasion I brought what seemed to be some cutting edge technology: The oculus quest 2. My team won the hackathon and both me and Julian were thrilled by the prospective opportunities that this technology promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple week after he told to me about a long forgotten project about videogames for the world war 1 in the Dolomites. I was over the top: the technology hyped me, the victory from the hackathon gave me so much confidence and the fact that a good bunch of money was involved was all I could see at that time. So I accepted, and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We proposed the project to the enterpreneur and he was more than stunned to see what this technology would enable and the (at the time) limitless possibilities of this piece of hardware. Off we went, after a couple weeks we got an offer and without esitations and no experience whatsoever we took the plunge. We were able to get all the burocracy done with the help of some friends and we were ready to show the world what we were capable of and to start a multi-billion euro company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;well-not-exactly&#34;&gt;Well not exactly
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all about the heroic and cool part. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have any experience, no computing hardware that was capable of doing anything near what we promised. And our skills were limited to what I and him learned in the University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to learn everything and do all from scratch. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we did. I got a new Gaming computer, set up everything, and in doing so I asked a friend for advice and he ended up joining us. We were now 3 undergraduates just trying to pull off a mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-plan&#34;&gt;The plan
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came back from Erasmus around August and the plan was to start from the 1st September and work until December, every day for 8 hours, 4 days a week. How long did we last?
Less than a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started strong but in the end I felt overwehlmed by the work as I put everything from my health, people to my wellbeing aside. I wanted this to be the most important thing in the next 6 months. I didn&amp;rsquo;t study German, and eventually I failed on it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t persue anything else than just working tirelessly.
I was heading directly towards the &lt;em&gt;valley of burnout&lt;/em&gt;. It was around October, nearly a year later, when most of us had resized the time allowed for this work that I found myself obsessing over something I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have. I am used to work many hours a day. But when it is for something I really care and I see my team working as me as well it is when I am pushed to my best and even further. In such a way I do grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not about the team: we were having good interactions, I learned to work in a group project as I did not during my university years, I learned new skills, learned how to manage a big project and retarget the plan once in a while. It was indeed an experience that improved me, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see myself growing in the right direction. And this insight was not clear from the beginning. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see anything that made me grow as a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was clear that my head was clashing against my actions, actions made towards a project that I long searched and thrived for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pain&#34;&gt;The pain
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pain arrived from more sides. I was literally sorrounded. I started lifting weights and going to the gym regularly every day since mid October, that has been my saving. The pain was still there but I learned to manage the physical one. The worst was indeed the mental pain.
It was for me way harder to manage, because I was not used to it and didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to handle it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as always when I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do, I seek advice from books, the masters of time. I started reading, I started journaling, I started going around with a backpack filled with weights in order to feel other pain, the more manageable one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November came and I remember it as the thoughest month of the year 2022. From the first day to the very last. But if I look back now, it was the most insightful and it teached me the most.
I was also going through some kind of relationship problems and that drained much of my mental energy. I started overthinking and I can feel the effects of it still now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-this-all-relate&#34;&gt;How does this all relate?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well the insights from that month, really stood strong and gave me direction on how to come out this lonely, heavy and fearful state of mind. Because everything is in our mind, if you want it or not.
Two facts really stood by me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start planning your life from the end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much would you do to have it if you did not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first resonates with me because I finally felt, and I was able to admit to myself, that I was going down the wrong path. There is nothing wrong with making such videogames and this career path. But at the end of my life I just didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be remembered as such figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second instead, taught me some hard lessons about work, love and life. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t have this position, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have done much to get into it. I was finally able to explain the situation. Also it taught me about love and what I had lost, it pushed me to try to get it back if I ever will. Because this shows how much I would have been doing, if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-be-continued&#34;&gt;To be continued&amp;hellip;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you would like to find out how it did end, well you might have to wait some time, because we missed the deadline and we are still working on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STAY TUNED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. let me know if you liked this personal stories and what would you like to develop more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The frog in the pot</title>

        <pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 14:36:13 +0200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/the-frog-in-the-pot/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/the-frog-in-the-pot/cover.JPG" alt="Featured image of post The frog in the pot" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-boiling-frog-an-analogy-for-climate-change&#34;&gt;The Boiling Frog: An Analogy for Climate Change
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of the boiling frog is a well-known analogy for the gradual and insidious nature of change. The tale goes that if a frog is placed in a pot of boiling water, it will immediately jump out to safety. However, if a frog is placed in a pot of cool water that is slowly heated, it will not notice the change and eventually be boiled to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;now&#34;&gt;Now
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analogy can be applied to the current situation of climate change. The Earth&amp;rsquo;s temperature is slowly and steadily rising, and many people are not taking notice or taking action. Just like the frog in the pot, we are becoming accustomed to the gradual changes and not realizing the danger we are in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how&#34;&gt;How
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climate change is caused by human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. These actions release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat and raising the Earth&amp;rsquo;s temperature. The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world, from rising sea levels and more intense storms, to droughts and wildfires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;denial&#34;&gt;Denial
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence of the reality and seriousness of climate change, there is still a significant portion of the population that denies or downplays the issue. This lack of action and denial can have dire consequences for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so&#34;&gt;So
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question remains, will we, as a society, take the necessary steps to reduce our carbon footprint and slow down climate change before it&amp;rsquo;s too late? Or will we, like the frog in the pot, be boiled to death by our own inaction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;then&#34;&gt;Then?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only time will tell, but one thing is clear: We must take immediate and decisive action to address climate change before it&amp;rsquo;s too late. The future of humanity depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a cyber-security challenge, in particular a capture the flag. I was lucky to get accepted in a team where a friend of mine was, since I my team-mate was sick
that day. I ended up in a team of super cool guys as well as very smart and experienced people. I learned a lot from them and I hope I was able to help them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenges were 5 and after arriving 1 hour late, we were able to solve them all before every other team and with nearly half an hour of spare time. We were the first team to finish the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot and I was also able to give my small contribution, but without the team I would have never been able to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There we are:&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;https://www.openstreetmap.org&lt;/a&gt;) and Mapillary (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.mapillary.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.mapillary.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our app, the user is interacting with the real world by solving &amp;ldquo;issues&amp;rdquo;. While taking a walk, the player can take photos, tackle time-based challenges, compete in an online leaderboard and much more. At the same time, this helps OpenStreetMap improve their tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built our User Interface with Flutter, our backend with Flask and trained our photo classification model with PyTorch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you have fun playing our game and we wish you a wonderful day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gotta catch ‘em issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hackathon was a very fun one because I did not know anybody once I got there. I had to find a team and a challenge. I was really stressed and worried.
In the end it turned out great! I met a lot of people and I had a lot of fun, if you want to know more just check the VLOG on youtube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following are some of the photos:&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/03_projects/hackathonnoi-2023/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Hackathon NOI - November 2022" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of our team was to develop a fully autonomous logistic system for hotels and vacations house to manage their laundry as well as textile such as curtains, carpets, and so on. The system relies on Arduino, to automate and track the movement and the current position of the textile in the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An app will also enable the staff members to read and update any value related to the articles of clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dashboard will also be available to the management in order to have accurate monitoring of the situation as well as giving advice of the best and most efficient actions to be taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There we are:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My First Post</title>
        <link>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/hello-world/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2022 20:21:13 +0200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/hello-world/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/hello-world/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post My First Post" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-motto-of-my-life&#34;&gt;The motto of my life
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a great question that I came across today. I thought it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too hard to come up with one, since I have so many thoughts and I am creative. That, sadly, didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. I turned then to a quote by Elon Musk, just to close and send the form I was filling. It was &amp;ldquo;Solve climate change or die trying&amp;rdquo;. I soon realized that it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like mine but I sent the quote anyway  because I had spent too much time on this. I need to think of a motto for my future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tragedy&#34;&gt;Tragedy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me that I always had, and still have mentors, people that really inspire me, is difficult to go off the known path and continue on the path less traveled. I know it is a trivial thing to do if I want to accomplish anything. But here I am struggling on a simple and &amp;ldquo;to be&amp;rdquo; catchy phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-now&#34;&gt;What now
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I think I am still dealing with som past experiences, and just recently got over them and accepted. I am finding a new path to follow for my life. A small light is appearing at the end of the tunnel. This has been a dark age of mine, and still is, but the fact that I reached the bottom, or so it seems, gives me hope.
I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen into the hopelessness hole and I was dizzily falling. One day I grasped on a though, actually a book. The essentialism. It gave me hope and a strong direction to follow.
Here I am putting my future actions into words. The most difficult and dangling part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-back-to-the-point&#34;&gt;Getting back to the point
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this moment I am taking the wheel of my life again, and I can think clearly only for a couple weeks now. This gives me hope in finding a new motto for my life. An original and unique one. One that resembles my optimism for the future, the hope in humanity, but that still keeps me humble in my infinitesimal littleness, but with the willingness to change the world for the better&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-next-step&#34;&gt;The next step
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is only one step forward. In the unknown. But is one and it must be steady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HackZurich is the biggest hackathon in Europe. It was a priviledge for me to be selected among the participants. Again I knew nobody, but in the end I met some old friends from other hackathons, we teamed up, we won and most importantly we had so much fun. Check out the VLOG on youtube.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/03_projects/osnahack-2022/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Osnahack - June 2022" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was in Erasmus I had the pleasure to work with brilliant people, Sing, Pravir and Giulia, in an hackathon in the city I was doing my Erasmus in. It was a great experience when I think back. We didn&amp;rsquo;t win or anything, but we had so much fun and I personally learned a lot afterwards, overanalysing the experience and how it
turned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what has been wrote about our project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bagel sorgt dafür, dass Radfahrer sicher und effizient in Osnabrück unterwegs sind. Das wird durch die Daten von Google Maps, GPS und Ampelplänen auf der App möglich. Indem unsere Stadt fahrradfreundlicher wird, werden die Osnabrücker dazu ermutigt, ein saubereres, friedlicheres und nachhaltigeres Zuhause zu schaffen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Osnahack, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://osnahack.de/rueckblick/&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Osnahack website&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In english also:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bagel ensures that cyclists can travel safely and efficiently in Osnabrück. This is made possible by data from Google Maps, GPS and traffic light plans on the app. By making our city more bike-friendly, Osnabrückers are encouraged to create a cleaner, more peaceful and sustainable home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Osnahack, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://osnahack.de/rueckblick/&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Osnahack website&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is mental health. It was the occasion in which I really get near to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the opportunity to learn about a new thing. Produce what I always liked, ideas. Startup-ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was selected among 40 finalist that have been invited to Milan, at the Bending spoons headquarters. It was an amazing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met some of the most brilliant mind I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met. I had the honour and luck to be able to talk to the 3 winners even before they were announced. As if I had a
6th sense of where greatness can be found. Jokes apart it was one of the best experiences of growth, emotions and learning in a couple of year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the photo you can see me casually at the centre, usually I am not there but this time I felt at home. With like-minded people. One of the best feelings in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There we are:&lt;/p&gt;

It was from the European association Climate-KIC, an European community that works to accelerate the transition to a zero emission
world. The email said: organize a climathon in your City. And that is what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked around if there was some interest in such an event, and I got a good feedback from Veronica a friend of my town. Together we said, let&amp;rsquo;s do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After many days, many calls, many emails, and many associations contacted, we were able to organize and successfully run a climathon in our Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an amazing experience. 40 people showed up and 7 projects were created to tackle our local challenges. Everybody was happy and so were we. I met so many new
people and young talents full of energy and desire to build, create and innovate. People that were my age and older, but we all shared the values of believing in
creating a future for us.&lt;/p&gt;
