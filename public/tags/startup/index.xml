        <description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/realverse/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Realverse" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;for-a-biscuit&#34;&gt;For a biscuit
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was late October and during a lesson of entrepreneurship and innovation the class moved outside to take a picture with the guest lecturer from the company &amp;ldquo;Dr. Schär&amp;rdquo;. He told us about his personal story and his business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was walking out the building and I casually met a person, who offered me a biscuit and we just started chatting about how the seminar went and why we were there. We spent more than an hour chatting around in the cold and under the rain, so I had to take the later bus. But it was worth it all the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-a-hackathon&#34;&gt;Why a hackathon
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julian and I kept in touch, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until the hackathon of November that we met in person and went off with two different teams. In that occasion I brought what seemed to be some cutting edge technology: The oculus quest 2. My team won the hackathon and both me and Julian were thrilled by the prospective opportunities that this technology promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple week after he told to me about a long forgotten project about videogames for the world war 1 in the Dolomites. I was over the top: the technology hyped me, the victory from the hackathon gave me so much confidence and the fact that a good bunch of money was involved was all I could see at that time. So I accepted, and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We proposed the project to the enterpreneur and he was more than stunned to see what this technology would enable and the (at the time) limitless possibilities of this piece of hardware. Off we went, after a couple weeks we got an offer and without esitations and no experience whatsoever we took the plunge. We were able to get all the burocracy done with the help of some friends and we were ready to show the world what we were capable of and to start a multi-billion euro company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;well-not-exactly&#34;&gt;Well not exactly
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all about the heroic and cool part. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have any experience, no computing hardware that was capable of doing anything near what we promised. And our skills were limited to what I and him learned in the University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to learn everything and do all from scratch. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we did. I got a new Gaming computer, set up everything, and in doing so I asked a friend for advice and he ended up joining us. We were now 3 undergraduates just trying to pull off a mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-plan&#34;&gt;The plan
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came back from Erasmus around August and the plan was to start from the 1st September and work until December, every day for 8 hours, 4 days a week. How long did we last?
Less than a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started strong but in the end I felt overwehlmed by the work as I put everything from my health, people to my wellbeing aside. I wanted this to be the most important thing in the next 6 months. I didn&amp;rsquo;t study German, and eventually I failed on it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t persue anything else than just working tirelessly.
I was heading directly towards the &lt;em&gt;valley of burnout&lt;/em&gt;. It was around October, nearly a year later, when most of us had resized the time allowed for this work that I found myself obsessing over something I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have. I am used to work many hours a day. But when it is for something I really care and I see my team working as me as well it is when I am pushed to my best and even further. In such a way I do grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not about the team: we were having good interactions, I learned to work in a group project as I did not during my university years, I learned new skills, learned how to manage a big project and retarget the plan once in a while. It was indeed an experience that improved me, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see myself growing in the right direction. And this insight was not clear from the beginning. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see anything that made me grow as a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was clear that my head was clashing against my actions, actions made towards a project that I long searched and thrived for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pain&#34;&gt;The pain
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pain arrived from more sides. I was literally sorrounded. I started lifting weights and going to the gym regularly every day since mid October, that has been my saving. The pain was still there but I learned to manage the physical one. The worst was indeed the mental pain.
It was for me way harder to manage, because I was not used to it and didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to handle it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as always when I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do, I seek advice from books, the masters of time. I started reading, I started journaling, I started going around with a backpack filled with weights in order to feel other pain, the more manageable one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November came and I remember it as the thoughest month of the year 2022. From the first day to the very last. But if I look back now, it was the most insightful and it teached me the most.
I was also going through some kind of relationship problems and that drained much of my mental energy. I started overthinking and I can feel the effects of it still now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-this-all-relate&#34;&gt;How does this all relate?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well the insights from that month, really stood strong and gave me direction on how to come out this lonely, heavy and fearful state of mind. Because everything is in our mind, if you want it or not.
Two facts really stood by me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start planning your life from the end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much would you do to have it if you did not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first resonates with me because I finally felt, and I was able to admit to myself, that I was going down the wrong path. There is nothing wrong with making such videogames and this career path. But at the end of my life I just didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be remembered as such figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second instead, taught me some hard lessons about work, love and life. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t have this position, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have done much to get into it. I was finally able to explain the situation. Also it taught me about love and what I had lost, it pushed me to try to get it back if I ever will. Because this shows how much I would have been doing, if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-be-continued&#34;&gt;To be continued&amp;hellip;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you would like to find out how it did end, well you might have to wait some time, because we missed the deadline and we are still working on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STAY TUNED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. let me know if you liked this personal stories and what would you like to develop more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a cyber-security challenge, in particular a capture the flag. I was lucky to get accepted in a team where a friend of mine was, since I my team-mate was sick
that day. I ended up in a team of super cool guys as well as very smart and experienced people. I learned a lot from them and I hope I was able to help them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenges were 5 and after arriving 1 hour late, we were able to solve them all before every other team and with nearly half an hour of spare time. We were the first team to finish the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot and I was also able to give my small contribution, but without the team I would have never been able to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There we are:&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;https://www.openstreetmap.org&lt;/a&gt;) and Mapillary (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.mapillary.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.mapillary.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our app, the user is interacting with the real world by solving &amp;ldquo;issues&amp;rdquo;. While taking a walk, the player can take photos, tackle time-based challenges, compete in an online leaderboard and much more. At the same time, this helps OpenStreetMap improve their tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built our User Interface with Flutter, our backend with Flask and trained our photo classification model with PyTorch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you have fun playing our game and we wish you a wonderful day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gotta catch ‘em issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hackathon was a very fun one because I did not know anybody once I got there. I had to find a team and a challenge. I was really stressed and worried.
In the end it turned out great! I met a lot of people and I had a lot of fun, if you want to know more just check the VLOG on youtube.&lt;/p&gt;

The system relies on Arduino, to automate and track the movement and the current position of the textile in the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An app will also enable the staff members to read and update any value related to the articles of clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dashboard will also be available to the management in order to have accurate monitoring of the situation as well as giving advice of the best and most efficient actions to be taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There we are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HackZurich is the biggest hackathon in Europe. It was a priviledge for me to be selected among the participants. Again I knew nobody, but in the end I met some old friends from other hackathons, we teamed up, we won and most importantly we had so much fun. Check out the VLOG on youtube.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/03_projects/osnahack-2022/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Osnahack - June 2022" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was in Erasmus I had the pleasure to work with brilliant people, Sing, Pravir and Giulia, in an hackathon in the city I was doing my Erasmus in. It was a great experience when I think back. We didn&amp;rsquo;t win or anything, but we had so much fun and I personally learned a lot afterwards, overanalysing the experience and how it
turned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what has been wrote about our project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bagel sorgt dafür, dass Radfahrer sicher und effizient in Osnabrück unterwegs sind. Das wird durch die Daten von Google Maps, GPS und Ampelplänen auf der App möglich. Indem unsere Stadt fahrradfreundlicher wird, werden die Osnabrücker dazu ermutigt, ein saubereres, friedlicheres und nachhaltigeres Zuhause zu schaffen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Osnahack, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://osnahack.de/rueckblick/&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Osnahack website&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In english also:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bagel ensures that cyclists can travel safely and efficiently in Osnabrück. This is made possible by data from Google Maps, GPS and traffic light plans on the app. By making our city more bike-friendly, Osnabrückers are encouraged to create a cleaner, more peaceful and sustainable home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Osnahack, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://osnahack.de/rueckblick/&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Osnahack website&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/03_projects/productflow-2021/cover.JPG" alt="Featured image of post Productflow 2021" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I presented this idea on a topic very near to me. That is mental health. It was the occasion in which I really get near to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the opportunity to learn about a new thing. Produce what I always liked, ideas. Startup-ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was selected among 40 finalist that have been invited to Milan, at the Bending spoons headquarters. It was an amazing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met some of the most brilliant mind I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met. I had the honour and luck to be able to talk to the 3 winners even before they were announced. As if I had a
6th sense of where greatness can be found. Jokes apart it was one of the best experiences of growth, emotions and learning in a couple of year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the photo you can see me casually at the centre, usually I am not there but this time I felt at home. With like-minded people. One of the best feelings in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There we are:&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/03_projects/climathon-2021/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Climathon" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2021, I received an email. It was from the European association Climate-KIC, an European community that works to accelerate the transition to a zero emission
world. The email said: organize a climathon in your City. And that is what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked around if there was some interest in such an event, and I got a good feedback from Veronica a friend of my town. Together we said, let&amp;rsquo;s do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After many days, many calls, many emails, and many associations contacted, we were able to organize and successfully run a climathon in our Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an amazing experience. 40 people showed up and 7 projects were created to tackle our local challenges. Everybody was happy and so were we. I met so many new
people and young talents full of energy and desire to build, create and innovate. People that were my age and older, but we all shared the values of believing in
creating a future for us.&lt;/p&gt;
